      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        We are KSUâ€™s Solar Vehicle Team. We are passionate students working towards
        a common goal of Solar Awesomeness. We are a competitive team that focuses
        on building solar-powered vehicles. Our current project is the Solar Power
        Car which we will design, build, and race in the American and World Solar
        Challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The American Solar challenge is an annual race where college teams, from
        around the world,  push their solar cars to their limits on a 2000 mile
        course across 9 states in 8 days.
      </p>
      <p>
        The World Solar Challenge is a bi-annual race where teams from around the
        world race 2,000 miles down the center of Austrailia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being a new team, we are akin to a start-up company. We are going all the
        way from concept to final product. Members can get as much knowledge and
        experience from the project as they want. They can participate in all stages
        of the design process. We accept members of all majors and backgrounds, and
        they can participate in as many teams as they would like.
